                    <p><h3>Saint Raymond of Penyafort, Priest (Optional Memorial</h3></p>
                    <p><strong>We should believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ. (1 John 3:23)</strong></p><br>
                    
                   <p>In a recent study, researchers interviewed American Christian youth, both Catholic and 
                   non-Catholic. The data indicated that although they called themselves Christians, many of the young 
                   people didn’t really grasp the essential truths of Christianity. They believed that God exists, but 
                   that he is far off and removed from their daily lives. They believed that God exists mainly to help 
                   them to become “better people.” In short, their answers revealed great confusion about their 
                   faith—almost like a cloud over their minds.</p>

                   <p>The First Letter of John was written in a time of a similar lack of clarity. Christians from many 
                   different backgrounds held different views about the identity of Jesus. Many disputed whether he 
                   could be both fully human and fully divine. Some wanted to place more of an emphasis on Jesus’ 
                   spiritual nature, hoping to avoid having to change the way they lived in this physical world. The 
                   author of 1 John wrote this letter to address these disagreements. He reminded them of the simple 
                   heart of Christianity: to believe that Jesus, the Son of God, became man for our salvation.</p>

                   <p>Similar to the first-century Christians, young people today can find themselves adrift. They may 
                   have gotten out of the habit of going to Sunday Mass. They may feel disillusioned and doubt that 
                   there is a place for them in the Church. Or perhaps their pursuit of career or family crowds out 
                   time for God. Still, God loves them, and he is always ready to welcome them and embrace them. But 
                   who will be his ambassadors?</p>

                   <pMaybe it’s you. Every one of us can help, even if it’s in just a small way. You can point your 
                   children or grandchildren toward Jesus by the way you love and care for your family. You can help 
                   make arrangements for your children or grandchildren to attend Vacation Bible School. Maybe there’s 
                   a teenager you know who needs a listening ear and a guiding voice. Even if you don’t have much 
                   interaction with young people, you can still help. Never underestimate the power of intercessory 
                   prayer.</p>
				   
				   <p>Who knows? You just may be the one whose prayers help part the clouds of confusion and encourage 
				   someone to take a step closer to Jesus!</p>
				   
                   <p><strong><i>“Lord, pour out your grace on all young people."</i></strong></p>

                            <p><strong>THE MESSAGE OF THE RICH YOUNG MAN</strong><br>
<strong>The beauty of a Holy Quest:</strong><br> ‘What must I do to inherit the Kingdom of God?’ remains still a valid and genuine quest in a world where many young men would rather ask ‘what must I do to belong?’ ‘What must I do to have money?’, 
‘What must I do to have great power, prestige, position etc.’ The young man teaches us desire for our home above which is often forgotten in the razzmatazz of earthly struggles! He teaches us that the Kingdom of God given to us 
by God’s grace has to be accessed; ‘inherited’ through human co-operation. He also teaches us to seek answers from Jesus as against other demonic alternatives. He also shows us other positive attitudes in the search; his humility

                        <p>Charles Lwanga (Luganda: Kaloli Lwanga (1 January 1860 – 3 June 1886) was a Ugandan convert
                            to the Catholic Church, who was martyred for his faith and is revered as a saint by both the
                            Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion.<br>
                            Charles Lwanga and the other Christians who accompanied him in death were canonized on
                            18 October 1964 by Pope Paul VI during the Vatican II conference. "To honor these African
                            saints, Paul VI became the first reigning pope to visit sub-Saharan Africa when he toured Uganda
                            in July 1969, a visit that included a pilgrimage to the site of the martyrdom at Namugongo".<br>

                                            <p>The history of St. Charles L’wanga Parish can be linked to the story of our Lord Jesus Christ who was born in a manger and later grew to greatness to become the Saviour of the world. It is a proud history of great achievements and contributions to evangelism in our neighborhood and the universal church in general.<br>
                                                We therefore pay glowing tributes to Late Etinyin Essien Etim Offiong III, an illustrious son of Essien Town, Progenitor of Catholicism in Calabar and its environs. <br>
                                                Available records show that the practice of the Catholic faith took root in Essien Town in 1915 following the celebration of the first Holy Mass here by Rev. Fr. F. Howell and J. Krafft in the compound of Late Chief Ekpenyong OtuAbasi which is directly opposite the present Church.<br>
                                                That historical First Mass was attended by over one hundred curious people who grew in number as the day grew by. Due to the upsurge in number of worshippers, the venue was moved to a bigger arena courtesy of Late Sir. Chief Frank U. A. Offiong (KSG). It was at this location that the member imbibed the culture of attending morning prayers daily in the absence of a Priest to celebrate morning Masses.<br>
                                                Subsequently, other religious activities continued in the same location until it became obvious that a permanent site was needed to establish a church. Most providentially, this became a reality when Late Mrs. Alice U. A. Offiong, wife of Late Sir. Frank U. A. Offiong (both parents of Late Rev. Fr. Michael Adim U. A. Offiong) donated her farm land for the building of the church.<br>
                                                This development warranted an appeal to Ireland, the home of Late Rev. Fr. Denis O’Hara, for financial assistance to commence the building of the church. With spirited attempts and various contributions by different people, what is now known as St. Charles L’wanga Parish, came into being on March 17, 1976 which was the feast day of Saint Patrick.<br>
                                                As it is the practice in the Catholic church, the Parish first began as an out – station of Sacred Heart Cathedral and later, of Immaculate Conception Parish, Ikot Ansa, Calabar. It was subsequently named St. Charles L’wanga Parish by the Late Archbishop of Calabar, His Grace, Most Rev. Dr. Brian Davis Usanga in honour of St. Charles L’wanga, one of the twenty – two (22) Martyrs from Uganda.</p>

                                            <p>One of 22 Ugandan martyrs, Charles Lwanga is the patron of youth and
                                                Catholic action in most of tropical Africa. He protected his fellow
                                                pages, aged 13 to 30, from the homosexual demands of the Bagandan ruler,
                                                Mwanga, and encouraged and instructed them in the Catholic faith during
                                                their imprisonment for refusing the ruler’s demands.<br>
                                                Charles first learned of Christ’s teachings from two retainers in the
                                                court of Chief Mawulugungu. While a catechumen, he entered the royal
                                                household as assistant to Joseph Mukaso, head of the court pages.<br>
                                                On the night of Mukaso’s martyrdom for encouraging the African youths to
                                                resist Mwanga, Charles requested and received baptism. Imprisoned with
                                                his friends, Charles’s courage and belief in God inspired them to remain
                                                chaste and faithful.<br>
                                                For his own unwillingness to submit to the immoral acts and his efforts
                                                to safeguard the faith of his friends, Charles was burned to death at
                                                Namugongo on June 3, 1886, by Mwanga’s order.<br> When Pope Paul VI
                                                canonized these 22 martyrs on October 18, 1964, he also made reference
                                                to the Anglican pages martyred for the same reason.<br><br>

                    <p>Growing up in Troyes, France, Marguerite formed a special relationship with Our Lady. She was 
                    turned away by two religious communities, but met the founder of Montreal, Canada, when he returned 
                    to France to visit his sister. He invited Marguerite to open a school in the New World; she went, 
                    despite misgivings, after praying to Mary. From that first school in an abandoned stable, her 
                    ministry grew to include teaching women crafts and founding the Sisters of the Congregation of 
                    Notre Dame. She managed to keep her sisters uncloistered, despite opposition from the bishop, and 
                    served as superior for many years. When Pope John Paul II canonized her in 1982, she became Canada’s 
                    first woman saint.

                            We receive from him whatever we ask, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases 
                            him. And his commandment is this: we should believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, 
                            and love one another just as he commanded us. Those who keep his commandments remain in him, 
                            and he in them, and the way we know that he remains in us is from the Spirit whom he gave 
                            us.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Beloved, do not trust every spirit but test the spirits to see whether they belong to God, 
                            because many false prophets have gone out into the world. This is how you can know the 
                            Spirit of God: every spirit that acknowledges Jesus Christ come in the flesh belongs to God, 
                            and every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus does not belong to God. This is the spirit 
                            of the antichrist who, as you heard, is to come, but in fact is already in the world. You 
                            belong to God, children, and you have conquered them, for the one who is in you is greater 
                            than the one who is in the world. They belong to the world; accordingly, their teaching 
                            belongs to the world, and the world listens to them. We belong to God, and anyone who knows 
                            God listens to us, while anyone who does not belong to God refuses to hear us. This is how 
                            we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of deceit.

                               When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew to Galilee. He left Nazareth 
                               and went to live in Capernaum by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali, that 
                               what had been said through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the way to the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of 
                               the Gentiles, the people who sit in darkness have seen a great light, on those dwelling 
                               in a land overshadowed by death light has arisen.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               From that time on, Jesus began to preach and say, "Repent, for the Kingdom of heaven is 
                               at hand."
                            </p>

                               He went around all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the Gospel of 
                               the Kingdom, and curing every disease and illness among the people. His fame spread to 
                               all of Syria, and they brought to him all who were sick with various diseases and 
                               racked with pain, those who were possessed, lunatics, and paralytics, and he cured them. 
                               And great crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, and Judea, and from beyond the 
                               Jordan followed him.

                                When Jesus saw the vast crowd, his heart was moved with pity for them, for they were 
                                like sheep without a shepherd; and he began to teach them many things. By now it was 
                                already late and his disciples approached him and said, "This is a deserted place and it 
                                is already very late. Dismiss them so that they can go to the surrounding farms and 
                                villages and buy themselves something to eat." He said to them in reply, "Give them some 
                                food yourselves." But they said to him, "Are we to buy two hundred days' wages worth of 
                                food and give it to them to eat?" He asked them, "How many loaves do you have?  Go and 
                                see." And when they had found out they said, "Five loaves and two fish." So he gave 
                                orders to have them sit down in groups on the green grass. The people took their places 
                                in rows by hundreds and by fifties. Then, taking the five loaves and the two fish and 
                                looking up to heaven, he said the blessing, broke the loaves, and gave them to his 
                                disciples to set before the people; he also divided the two fish among them all. They 
                                all ate and were satisfied. And they picked up twelve wicker baskets full of fragments 
                                and what was left of the fish. Those who ate of the loaves were five thousand men.

                               Beloved, if God so loved us, we also must love one another. No one has ever seen God. 
                               Yet, if we love one another, God remains in us, and his love is brought to perfection in 
                               us.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               This is how we know that we remain in him and he in us, that he has given us of his 
                               Spirit. Moreover, we have seen and testify that the Father sent his Son as savior of the 
                               world. Whoever acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him and he in 
                               God. We have come to know and to believe in the love God has for us.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               God is love, and whoever remains in love remains in God and God in him. In this is love 
                               brought to perfection among us, that we have confidence on the day of judgment because as 
                               he is, so are we in this world. There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out 
                               fear because fear has to do with punishment, and so one who fears is not yet perfect in 
                               love.

                              After the five thousand had eaten and were satisfied, Jesus made his disciples get into 
                              the boatand precede him to the other side toward Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd. 
                              And when he had taken leave of them, he went off to the mountain to pray. When it was 
                              evening, the boat was far out on the sea and he was alone on shore. Then he saw that they 
                              were tossed about while rowing, for the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of 
                              the night, he came toward them walking on the sea. He meant to pass by them. But when they 
                              saw him walking on the sea, they thought it was a ghost and cried out. They had all seen 
                              him and were terrified. But at once he spoke with them, "Take courage, it is I, do not be 
                              afraid!" He got into the boat with them and the wind died down. They were completely 
                              astounded. They had not understood the incident of the loaves. On the contrary, their 
                              hearts were hardened.

                                Beloved, we love God because he first loved us. If anyone says, "I love God," but hates 
                                his brother, he is a liar; for whoever does not love a brother whom he has seen cannot 
                                love God whom he has not seen. This is the commandment we have from him: Whoever loves 
                                God must also love his brother.
                            </p>

                               Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is begotten by God, and everyone who loves 
                               the Father loves also the one begotten by him. In this way we know that we love the 
                               children of God when we love God and obey his commandments. For the love of God is this, 
                               that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome, for whoever is 
                               begotten by God conquers the world. And the victory that conquers the world is our faith.

Grace to you and peace from God our Father
and the Lord Jesus Christ.
</p>
<p>
I give thanks to my God always on your account
for the grace of God bestowed on you in Christ Jesus,
that in him you were enriched in every way,
with all discourse and all knowledge,
as the testimony to Christ was confirmed among you,
so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift
as you wait for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
He will keep you firm to the end,
irreproachable on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
God is faithful,
and by him you were called to fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

                              Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news of him spread throughout 
                              the whole region. He taught in their synagogues and was praised by all.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               He came to Nazareth, where he had grown up, and went according to his custom into the 
                               synagogue on the sabbath day. He stood up to read and was handed a scroll of the prophet 
                               Isaiah. He unrolled the scroll and found the passage where it was written: The Spirit of 
                               the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring glad tidings to the poor. He has 
                               sent me to proclaim liberty to captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the 
                               oppressed go free, and to proclaim a year acceptable to the Lord.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               Rolling up the scroll, he handed it back to the attendant and sat down, and the eyes of 
                               all in the synagogue looked intently at him. He said to them, "Today this Scripture 
                               passage is fulfilled in your hearing." And all spoke highly of him and were amazed at the 
                               gracious words that came from his mouth.

                               Who indeed is the victor over the world but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of 
                               God?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               This is the one who came through water and Blood, Jesus Christ, not by water alone, but 
                               by water and Blood. The Spirit is the one who testifies, and the Spirit is truth. So 
                               there are three who testify, the Spirit, the water, and the Blood, and the three are of 
                               one accord. If we accept human testimony, the testimony of God is surely greater. Now the 
                               testimony of God is this, that he has testified on behalf of his Son. Whoever believes in 
                               the Son of God has this testimony within himself. Whoever does not believe God has made 
                               him a liar by not believing the testimony God has given about his Son. And this is the 
                               testimony: God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Whoever possesses the 
                               Son has life; whoever does not possess the Son of God does not have life.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               I write these things to you so that you may know that you have eternal life, you who 
                               believe in the name of the Son of God.

Hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit that has been given to us. For Christ, while we were still helpless, 
died at the appointed time for the ungodly. Indeed, only with difficulty does one die for a just person, though perhaps for a good person one might even find courage to die. 
But God proves his love for us in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us. How much more then, since we are now justified by his Blood, will we be saved through him 
from the wrath. Indeed, if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, how much more, once reconciled, will we be saved by his life. Not only that, 
but we also boast of God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.
</p>
<p><h1>OR</h1></p>
<p>
Brothers and sisters:<br>
Are you unaware that we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were indeed buried with him through baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised 
from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might live in newness of life.
</p>
<p>
For if we have grown into union with him through a death like his, we shall also be united with him in the resurrection. We know that our old self was crucified with him, so that our sinful body 
might be done away with, that we might no longer be in slavery to sin. For a dead person has been absolved from sin. If, then, we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him. 
We know that Christ, raised from the dead, dies no more; death no longer has power over him.

                           It happened that there was a man full of leprosy in one of the towns where Jesus was; and 
                           when he saw Jesus, he fell prostrate, pleaded with him, and said, "Lord, if you wish, you can 
                           make me clean." Jesus stretched out his hand, touched him, and said, "I do will it.  Be made 
                           clean." And the leprosy left him immediately. Then he ordered him not to tell anyone, but 
                           "Go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses prescribed; that 
                           will be proof for them." The report about him spread all the more, and great crowds assembled 
                           to listen to him and to be cured of their ailments, but he would withdraw to deserted places 
                           to pray.

                               We have this confidence in him that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears 
                               us. And if we know that he hears us in regard to whatever we ask, we know that what we 
                               have asked him for is ours. If anyone sees his brother sinning, if the sin is not deadly, 
                               he should pray to God and he will give him life. This is only for those whose sin is not 
                               deadly. There is such a thing as deadly sin, about which I do not say that you should 
                               pray. All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that is not deadly.

                               We know that anyone begotten by God does not sin; but the one begotten by God he protects, 
                               and the Evil One cannot touch him. We know that we belong to God, and the whole world is 
                               under the power of the Evil One. We also know that the Son of God has come and has given 
                               us discernment to know the one who is true. And we are in the one who is true, in his Son 
                               Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. Children, be on your guard against

                               Jesus and his disciples went into the region of Judea, where he spent some time with them 
                               baptizing. John was also baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was an abundance of 
                               water there, and people came to be baptized, for John had not yet been imprisoned. Now a 
                               dispute arose between the disciples of John and a Jew about ceremonial washings. So they 
                               came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, the one who was with you across the Jordan, to whom 
                               you testified, here he is baptizing and everyone is coming to him." John answered and 
                               said, "No one can receive anything except what has been given from heaven. You yourselves 
                               can testify that I said that I am not the Christ, but that I was sent before him. The one 
                               who has the bride is the bridegroom; the best man, who stands and listens for him, 
                               rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice. So this joy of mine has been made complete. 
                               He must increase; I must decrease."

                               those oppressed by the devil, for God was with him."

                                The grace of God has appeared, saving all and training us to reject godless ways and 
                                worldly desires and to live temperately, justly, and devoutly in this age, as we await 
                                the blessed hope, the appearance of the glory of our great God and savior Jesus Christ, 
                                who gave himself for us to deliver us from all lawlessness and to cleanse for himself a 
                                people as his own, eager to do what is good.
                            </p>

                                When the kindness and generous love of God our savior appeared, not because of any 
                                righteous deeds we had done but because of his mercy, He saved us through the bath of 
                                rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, whom he richly poured out on us through Jesus 
                                Christ our savior, so that we might be justified by his grace and become heirs in hope 
                                of eternal life.

                               The people were filled with expectation, and all were asking in their hearts whether John 
                               might be the Christ. John answered them all, saying, "I am baptizing you with water, but 
                               one mightier than I is coming. I am not worthy to loosen the thongs of his sandals. He 
                               will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."

                               After all the people had been baptized and Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, 
                               heaven was opened and the Holy Spirit descended upon him in bodily form like a dove. And 
                               a voice came from heaven, "You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased."
